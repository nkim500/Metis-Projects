- Above chart, as part of initial findings, shows the traffic trend between 10:00am EST and 4:00pm EST for days in June and July 2021 at the 10 most highly-trafficked subway stations in NYC. 
- As expected, the marketing efforts are likely to get less exposure to the public during weekends as traffic tends to dip significantly across all stations for the daily time window analyzed. 
- The line charts also display a general uptrend in traffic at the subway stations since more people in NYC have been getting vaccinated, with COVID-19 restrictions lifted on June 15, 2021.
