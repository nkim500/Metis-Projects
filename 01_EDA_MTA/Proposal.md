We submit the following proposal in response to your inquiry regarding Metis' engagement to support arranging the ground presence via MTA subway data analysis:

[To be reworded] ##What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
WomenTechWomenYes ("WTWY") aims to raise attendance at its annual summer gala and concurrently build awareness by engaging with target demographics near subway stations to maximize exposure to traffic.
The target demographics would be potential attendees of the gala and/or have relevance/influence in increasing participation of women in technology.
In this context, we propose to identify the optimal placement of your street team that maximizes the exposure to your target demographic. 
[redacted: subway stations in the vicinity of WeWork locations in New York's 5 boroughs as proxy for locations with high concentration of this demographic]

The specifications of our deliverables would include the following:

Primary data source: the weekly aggregated MTA subway turnstile data ("MTA data") published by MTA. 
Data processing environment: aggregate, processe and analyze MTA data using SQLite3 and Python 3 (and its packages such as pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, matplotlib) 
What you will receive: exploratory data analyses and visualizations which recommend the times and locations for optimal street team placements
