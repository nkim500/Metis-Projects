## Proposal in response to your inquiry regarding Metis' engagement to support arranging the ground presence via MTA subway data analysis

**WomenTechWomenYes ("WTWY")** aims to raise attendance at its annual summer gala and concurrently build awareness by engaging with target demographics near subway stations. Per your request, we understand the target demographics to be potential attendees of the gala and/or have relevance/influence in increasing participation of women in technology. In light of this, we aim to deliver a specific recommendation which outlines the optimal strategy for placement of your street team that maximizes the exposure to your target demographic. 

### The specifications of our deliverables would include the following:
* **Primary data source:** 
  - The weekly aggregated MTA subway turnstile data ("MTA data") published by MTA
* **Data processing and its environment:**
  - Aggregate, processe and analyze MTA data using SQLite3 and Python 3 (and its packages such as pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, matplotlib) 
* **Outline of deliverables:**
  - Project proposal, outliing the scope of work
  - Minimum viable product ("MVP"), exemplifying a simplified version of the final deliverable - an analysis of subsample of turnstile traffic data & visuals
  - Final deliverable - recommendation on timing and locations for public engagement, supplemented by exploratory data analyses and visualizations, in (i) slides + 5 minute walkthrough, (ii) writeup, and (iii) code formats

### Certain **assumptions** will be made within this deliverable, including but not limited to: 
  1. *Timing of the gala and preceding marketing efforts: early summer is assumed to be either June or July, thus the marketing effort is assumed to take place anytime in the same year prior to the gala*
  2. *Hours for marketing efforts: New Yorkers are assumed to be less engaging during the time of the day which overlaps with their commute time window*
  3. *Human resource: the number of staff in the street teams is assumed to have no limitations*
  4. ~~*Type of demographic: subway stations in the vicinity of WeWork locations in New York's 5 boroughs is assumed to have higher concentrations of target demographic than otherwise*~~

### Timeline
* Project proposal delivered by 6:00PM EST Wednesday, September 8, 2021
* MVP will be delivered by 6:00PM EST Tuesday, September 14, 2021
* Final deliverable will be delivered by 11:00AM EST Friday, September 17, 2021
