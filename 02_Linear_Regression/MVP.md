# Analysis of NBA player annual salary and their season production on court

This project aims to interpret the relationship between NBA players and their on-court production. 

The following is a correlation coefficient for each predictor variables (with some basic feature engineering) from the initial dataset against the target variable.

The following is another baseline model output, based on a narrower set of data selected based on intuition.

The following is a pairplot of subset of features from the initial dataset, which displays distribution of a variable against another in the dataset. Certain characteristics stand out, such as right-skewedness of the target variable 'salary_usd' and collinearity among certain features.

The model outputs and pairplot will help to guide the next steps in feature engineering, followed by model validation techniques, and ultimately in improving model r^2.
