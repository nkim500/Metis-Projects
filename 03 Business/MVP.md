# Exploratory data analysis of UFC fights and betting odds

### Brief intro
This project aims to help fine-tune opening odds for an online sports betting company. The dataset contains fight statistics and closing betting odds for UFC fights. UFC has grown in popularity over the years as you can see from the number of fights per annum in the bar chart below:

Opening odds are listed on respective online sports betting venues around the time when fights are announced. The listed odds will change over the course of time depending on new information as well as due to influx of bets, until the fight begins with the closing odds. By having an accurate forecast of closing odds, an online sports betting company can maximize their revenue potential from each fight.

When the moneyline reads -110 / +120 for fighter A vs. fighter B, fighter A is more favored to win. The odds are implying that if the fighter A in fact wins the fight, a bet of $110 for fighter A gets a payout of $100. If fighter B ends up winning the fight, a bet of $100 for fighter B pays out $120. The spread in this moneyline would be 230. If the probability of winning is very even, both sides of the moneyline could be negative (e.g. -110/-105)

Most of the times, either side of the fight have a relatively similar probability of winning, as you can see from the charts below. Also, the spread for a title bout tends to have more extreme moneyline readings.
