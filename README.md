# Portfolio of projects done at Metis

Herein are some of the projects I completed during the Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp program at Metis in Fall 2021.

### Classification of fraudulent Ethereum accounts
- Trained models to classify fraudulent accounts on Ethereum blockchain based on the accounts' activity history
- Used XGBoost and Scikit-Learn classifiers including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Trees
- Determined hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and visualized results with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Each observations consist of a distinct Ethereum blockchain account with features as its profile information

### Image classification of tumor in brain MRI
- Built neural networks to determine presence of tumor in brain MRI images
- Used TensorFlow / Keras for convolutional neural networks and transfer learning from MobileNet v2 
- Visualized results with VisualKeras and Keract

### Web application for wind forecast dashboard
- Created dashboard displaying wind forecast data to support kitesurfers' trip planning
- Used Python packages to fetch API data and deployed web application on Streamlit
- Data is sourced from Weather.gov in JSON format which is parsed with Python script 

### Linear regression of NBA players' value
- Evaluated the relationship between NBA player on-court performance and their salary
- Used BeautifulSoup to scrape NBA player statistics in HTML format which was engineered to be fit for linear regression
- Evaluated regression outputs and regularized using LASSO to determine statistically significant variables

### Topic modeling of hip-hop lyrics using NLP
- Modeled topics in lyrics from well-known hip-hop artists
- Used Spacy and NLTK among others for data preparation and TruncatedSVD, NMF, LDA and CorEx for topic modeling
- Standardized slangs and genre-specific lingos as a part of feature engineering 
- Visualized Latent Dirichlet Allocation with pyLDAvis
